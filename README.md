# My final cousework paper slides using the reveal.js framework

This is my fork of the reveal.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js) framework that I'm relying on to do my final cousework paper (TCC) slides at UTFPR-PG.
I'm using it as a submodule of other git project forking reveal.js just to play safe.
